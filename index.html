          <h3 class="card-title">My Background</h3>
          <p class="card-text"><span class="background">Before starting at Epicodus, my life has been very Theatre oriented.I began acting at the age of 8 and my love for the art form grew
            as I got older. I attended <strong>Pacific University</strong> after graduating high school in 2008. At Pacific University, I fell in love with Theatrical Design.
            I decided to pursue Scenic and Lighting Design work after graduating in 2012.</span>
          </p>               
          <p class="card-text"><span class="background">Over the next decade, I worked in the professional Theatre world in
            Portland. I worked with Shaking the Tree Theatre, Third Rail Rep, Theatre Vertigo, Profile Theatre, ART, and other professional companies. 
            I also found a lot of work in Educational Theatre, working at Da Vinci Middle School, Tigard High School, and Clark College. Working in education, 
            I discovered I was a good teacher.</span>
          </p>                 
          <p class="card-text"><span class="background">After years of convincing from my wife and in-laws (who were educators) I decided to pursue my Master's of Education.
            I graduated from <strong>George Fox</strong> in April of 2021 and began work as a Drama Teacher at Oregon City High School. Although I love Theatre and teaching,
            I found that the world of education is not a stable enough environnment for me and I began looking for new avenues of employment. I also noticed
            that my love of Theatre had changed over the years due to it being a job and not a hobby. I joined <strong>Epicodus</strong> in August of 2022. My hope is that 
            through coding, I will have a better work-life balance and hopefully rekindle my passion for Theatre.</span>
